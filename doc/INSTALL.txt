= Install inreach-portal =

Create a database with schema from "db.sql"
and user with "select,insert,update" privileges

See the example config files in conf/

You also need to setup a system/daemon/nologin user/group "inreach"
and allow the user to write to the log/ directory
(either "chown inreach log" or "chgrp inreach log").

We run the server daemon with "forever" from npm:

    npm install forever -g

forever maintains its state in `../.forever` -- if you test
the daemon as another user, you'll need to delete this dir
before running as a system service so user inreach can write it.

See `etc/init.d/inreach-portal` or `etc/inreach.service`
for system integration.

Deploy via "git push" can be accomplished with help
from `etc/hooks/post-receive`
