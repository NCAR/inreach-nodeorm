Simple, quick app to save incoming data
from Garmin/DeLorme inReach Connect IPC Outbound service.
Uses Node.js, Express, and node-orm2.

== TODO ==

**MAJOR** updates have been performed for node v13
and the latest module versions. There has been only
limited testing with sample data.

**NO TESTING** has yet been done with real Garmin
connectivity. By the time of the next usage,
more updates for the latest versions of node and
the various modules will probably be needed.
